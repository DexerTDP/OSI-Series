7. Observations & Hypotheses

- There's high signs of emotional reaction and condemenation, looking for confirmation bias. People are looking to put blame or target without giving the event or timeline 
being established by the people whose job it is to do that and getting paid for it. The overall reaction proves without a doubt that people, regardless of views. Hold the same
foundation of selective chosing based on how a topic or a person makes them feel or think. 

- Automation is not involved, however bots are slightly involved in amplyfing based on what they are programed to do regardless of right or left to keep the divide alive

- real world impact has already happened before Charlie Kirk's assinsation. Reactions were very similar to this but now the sphere's changed.
